## RESEARCH EXPERIENCES
**Study on Roles of NF-ΚB Signaling Pathways in Ligament Ossification in Ankylosing Spondylitis(AS)**   

- 03/2013-07/2015: National College Students Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program
  - **Advisor**: Prof. Lu Fangguo
  - **Position**: Project Designer and Leader of 3-Member Group

    - Studied references about AS pathogenesis, animal model, and NF-κB signaling pathway, learned the skills of laboratory animal techniques, IHC, ELISA, DNA and protein extraction, and western blotting, and designed the research subject.
    - Obtained clinical specimens of patients with AS undergoing hip replacement, utilized IHC to detect expression of NF-κB signaling pathway transcription factor p65, downstream gene A20 and Wnt signaling pathway transcription factor β-catenin and osteogenic signal osteocalcin in hip ligament tissues.
    - Quantified the protein expression in IHC images by imageplus6.0, and did statistic analysis on the expression differences of p65, A20, OCN and β-catenin proteins in AS and control groups using SPSS.
    - Innovation: Explored the molecular mechanism of AS ligament ossification, used AS fibroblasts as target cells to study the molecular mechanism of pathological osteogenesis
